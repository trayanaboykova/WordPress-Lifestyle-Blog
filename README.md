# WordPress-Lifestyle-Blog
This project was created as part of the [WordPress for Developers Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4782/wordpress-for-developers-october-2024#lesson-80300). The goal was to build a WordPress-based website with a custom theme and plugin to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts learned.
